# TinFoilTiger

A memory-only and zero-persistence web application framework, written in Haskell.

At its core, the framework uses a pure in-memory architecture to execute application logic with minimal disk I/O overhead. It features a special HTML templating engine that integrates Tailwind CSS for dynamically generating responsive, utility-first UI components at build time. Notably, the framework employs Redis as the primary, volatile data storeâ€”eschewing traditional data persistence to maximize throughput and reduce latency. This architecture is ideal for applications where rapid, transient data processing is paramount.

## 1. Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

## 2. Installation

    curl -fsSL https://files.ryangerardwilson.com/tinfoiltiger/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/tinfoiltiger.gpg
    echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tinfoiltiger.gpg] https://files.ryangerardwilson.com/tinfoiltiger/debian stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tinfoiltiger.list
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt-get install tinfoiltiger

This ensures the following are installed: Stack, Redis, a custom Tailwind CSS utility tool (required by the Setup.hs of your project)

    tinfoiltiger --init

## 3. Subsequent Updates

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install --only-upgrade tinfoiltiger

## 4. Quick Start

Once initialized, run the application, execute it with the `--new` flag followed by the name of your project.

    tinfoiltiger --new <PROJECT_NAME>

The above command will display a list of templates to choose from. You can then re-run with the indicated template name.

    tinfoiltiger --new <PROJECT_NAME> --template <TEMPLAE_NAME>

## 5. Upgrading Your TinFoilTiger Project

TinFoilTiger scaffolds projects with a lib/TinFoilTiger directory. This way, when you run the below upgrade command, the contents of this directory will be replaced, leaving the rest of your project unaffected.

    cd your/tinFoilTiger/project/root/dir
    tinfoiltiger --upgrade
